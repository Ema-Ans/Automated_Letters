# Automated_Letters - Snoonu Backend Engineer Intern Project #02

## Project Objective:
To automate the production of letters. 
Previously, staff had to manually enter the same information for each employee across different templates and letters, a repetitive and error-prone process. 
The goal was to streamline this task, reducing manual effort and minimizing the risk of errors.

##   Results and Impact:

Result: Successful Automation of Letter Production
Impact: The automation of letter production significantly reduced the time and effort required to generate employee letters. By eliminating the need for manual data entry across different templates, the process became more efficient and consistent.
Result: Reduced Errors and Improved Accuracy
Impact: Automating the letter creation process minimized the risk of human errors, ensuring that each letter contained accurate and consistent information. This improvement in accuracy has led to higher quality and reliability in the generated documents.
Result: Increased Productivity
Impact: With the automation in place, staff can now focus on more strategic and value-added tasks rather than spending time on repetitive data entry. This increase in productivity allows the team to handle a higher volume of work without additional resources.
Result: Scalability for Future Needs
Impact: The automated system is scalable and can easily accommodate additional templates or changes to letter content in the future. This flexibility ensures that the system will continue to meet the organizationâ€™s needs as it grows.

On each excel workbook for each company, I added buttons on each sheet, which when you press will generate the letters, given that you specify the template file names in the specified fields. Please let me know if it works on your end.
